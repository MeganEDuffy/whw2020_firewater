### The problem:

Wildfire regimes are shifting in western North America as global temperatures rise and combine with the effects of historial fire suppression and increased bark beetle infestations. The wildfire season is growing longer and more intense, with fire burning hotter and covering more land. The effects of local catastrophic wildfire on water quality and ecological changes in lakes, however, are poorly understood. In this project, we pursue the following questions using remote sensing data. 

* What is the impact on lake surface temperature after fire?
* What are the timescales water quality shifts after a fire?

With an initial focus on a single lake in northern California, our goal is to develop an analysis framework easily reporducible and applicable to other aquatic systems affected by fire.

### The case study: Clear Lake Reservoir, CA

![Tucker fire reaches Clear Lake in 2019](https://github.com/MeganEDuffy/whw2020_firewater/blob/master/tucker-fire-clear.jpeg)

The Upper Lost River/Clear Lake Reservoir watershed drains the north-central portion of the Modoc Plateau to the Clear Lake Reservoir, which feeds the Lost River. The Lost River flows northwesterly into Oregon, where it traversing about 100 miles before returning to California and ending in a closed drainage basin at Tule Lake, including reclaimed wetlands in the Tule Lake National Wildlife Refuge, a key staging area for migrating waterfowl in North America. The reservoir is in Modoc National Forest and Clear Lake National Wildlife Refuge.

Clear Lake Reservoir has experienced large wildfire events in the recent past, including the Tucker Fire in July 2019 (14,150 acres), which burned to the lake's rim.

Lake surface area: 104.247 km2 (25,760 acres)

Ave. depth at max. capacity: 6 m (20 ft)

Water volume: 0.650 km3 (527,000 acreâ‹…ft)

### Land and water acknowledgement: 

The Clear Lake Reservoir is a small part of the ancestral homelands of the Modoc people, who have stewarded these lands and waters from time immemorial to today. Ignoring the proposals of the Modoc, Klamath, and Yahooskin Band of Snake tribes, the United States forcibly negotiated a Treaty of Council Grove in 1864 (ratified in 1870) that extinguished most tribal land rights and established a reservation north of traditional Modoc land.

### Specific goals:
* Learn to access and manipulate remote sensing data and time series meteorological data using python
* Build a data aquisition and analysis framework applicable to other sites

---

### Broader impacts:

* Answering questions about lake surface temperature disturbances leads to implications for ecosystem impacts 
* Potential for interpolation to lake systems too small for remote sensing surface temperature determinations


### Data sources:

* ECOSTRESS geotiff files and use to visualize spatial distribution surrounding fire event
* MODIS time series 10 year recond from [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/)
* Snow Telemetry - [SNOTEL](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/wcc/home/quicklinks/imap#version=125&elements=&networks=!&states=!&counties=!&hucs=&minElevation=&maxElevation=&elementSelectType=all&activeOnly=true&activeForecastPointsOnly=false&hucLabels=false&hucIdLabels=false&hucParameterLabels=true&stationLabels=&overlays=&hucOverlays=2&basinOpacity=75&basinNoDataOpacity=25&basemapOpacity=100&maskOpacity=0&mode=data&openSections=dataElement,parameter,date,basin,options,elements,location,networks&controlsOpen=true&popup=&popupMulti=&base=esriNgwm&displayType=station&basinType=6&dataElement=WTEQ&depth=-8&parameter=PCTMED&frequency=DAILY&duration=I&customDuration=&dayPart=E&year=2020&month=8&day=31&monthPart=E&forecastPubMonth=6&forecastPubDay=1&forecastExceedance=50&seqColor=1&divColor=7&scaleType=D&scaleMin=&scaleMax=&referencePeriodType=POR&referenceBegin=1981&referenceEnd=2010&minimumYears=20&hucAssociations=true&lat=42.1008&lon=-121.0913&zoom=10.0) 
* [DayMet](https://daymet.ornl.gov/) gridded estimates of daily weather parameters
* Possible: monthly evapotranspiration data from SSEBop model based on MODIS
* Possible future integration of buoy data and/or low-resolution in situ profile temperature, chlorophyll-a, nutrients, sediment load, or geophysical properties
